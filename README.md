MountIt - A WildStar addon for mount management



MountIt corrects a few issues with mounts in Wildstar, and adds a random mount feature.

You can:

    -Set your default mount to persist across logins
    -Enable automatic dismounting when you visit a crafting table
    -Randomize your mount each time you dismount, for when you have multiple mounts you'd like to cycle through

To open the configuration screen, type /mountit or open the options from the Game Menu or the Interface Menu.

Notes:

    -When choosing random, if you do not select any mounts it will use all mounts that you have as the randomized list. To limit this to certain mounts you specify, click them in the mounts list to enable/disable them
    -"dismount while crafting" will be enabled by default, but you can turn it off in the options
