To limit this to certain mounts you specify, click them in the mounts list to enable/disable them\r\n* \"dismount while crafting\" will be enabled by default, but you can turn it off in the options\r\n\r\n\r\nAvailable on Curse: http://www.curse.com/ws-addons/wildstar/222060-mountit\r\n\r\n\r\n## Screens:\r\n\r\n![Default](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bricriu/mountit/screens/Default.png)\r\n\r\n![Default](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bricriu/mountit/screens/Random.png)\r\n\r\n![Default](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bricriu/mountit/screens/Interface.png)","google":"UA-52562440-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
